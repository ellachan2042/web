<h2>Origin of Dogs</h2>
<p>In modern times, dogs have become a popular companion for many individuals. A quick walk in the neighborhood will prove just that. But, these cute and fluffy companions didn't always exist.
 Going back 40,000 years, researchers have come to the conclusion that dogs are descendents of wolves. It's assumed that humans formed a bond with wolves and they slowly evolved into dogs. 
 However, within the scientific community there is a lot of controversy surrounding this topic. Scientists are uncertain about how wolves became dogs. Some believe that hunter-gatherers domesticated wolves 
 while others believe that wolves domesticated by themselves. Like any other discovery, scientists are resorting to DNA to uncover the truths; it certainly provided some insight. Scientists compared mitochondrial genomes of 
 modern dogs and wolves to discovered fossils. They now believe that wolves were domesticated in either Europe of western Siberia. To be fair, the only thing scientists definitively know is that dogs came from wolves. 
 There are too many unknowns for scientists to be certain and all the wolves that gave rise to dogs are now extinct. At the end of the day, it's pretty cool to say that your dog is related to a wolf.</p>

<h2>Owning a Dog</h2>
<p>As a fellow dog owner, I must admit that dogs are <i>a lot</i> of work; just envision raising a baby. Dogs require your absolute attention at all times when you first get them. Usually, breeders will
 wait till dogs are 8 weeks old before you bring them home. Before their arrival, you want to make sure you have all the necessities they need: a cage, pee pee pads, toys, treats, food, a bed, and etc. The first 
 couple of days will be rough, I won't lie. Your puppy will most likely pee everywhere, poop everywhere, and chew on everything. Within the first week my dogs wrecked the carpet in my room. And just to let you know 
 the first night will be rough. It's crucial that you get your dogs situated with the cage, they need to get used to the idea of associating the cage with a happy place; most dog owners will leave their dogs in their 
 cage for an errand or a night out. So, on the first night, your puppy will most likely cry and cry and cry and you won't get any sleep. Are you guys starting to see the resemblance to newborns? And as another tip, focus
 on potty training your dogs before any other tricks. Now comes the expenses, on top of all the cute toys and things you just bought your new puppy, you are going to spend quite a big of money on shots, vaccinations, and 
 medications. The first few months will be rough, but, soon enough, your dog will require less walks, become potty trained, and learn cute tricks. Here, you have entered a phase I like to call "The Honeymoon". 
 Your puppy will develop cute habits and you'll finally reach a state of harmony. Everything seems to be going well and you learn to love the little weirdo running around your house. Surprise shawty, dogs have teenage
 phases too. My dog, Whiskey, was a rebel at about 6 months old. He peed on the couch, bed sheets, random places in the house, and dragged me down the street on every single week. Like humans, they do pass this phase and 
 it's important to note that they do at an impressive rate; 2 weeks compared to 2 years. I just want to end this by saying that all of these little moments might seem overwhelming and at times they are but it's all 
 worth it. They really do become your best friend. This is just my personal experience but for a general idea on the specifics read about it in the link below!</p>

<h2>Reasons Why You Should Get a Dog</h2>
<p>Hopefully you're still reading after all the horrible things I described. But now's my time to shine. There are a multitude of reasons as to why you should get a dog.</p>
 
<p>Being one of the most obvious reasons, dogs will be beneficial towards your physical health. Depending on the type of breed you have, some dogs will require more exercise. Your dog will push you to get out of the house
by taking them on walks, going to dog parks, and meeting up with their furry friends. Get ready to see some toned calves!</p>
 
<p>Dogs will also help your mental health. Apparently, hanging out with your dog for a few moments will help you reduce stress. This occurs through the release of dopamine and serotonin in your brain. Besides, dogs will become
accustomed to how you feel. At some point, they'll be able to tell if you're having a bad day and need some extra support.</p>
 
<p>Depending on what you're seeking, dogs can be trained to be anything. It's well known that dogs can be trained to be service animals, to serve in the military or on a police force, to notify you if there is an intruder
entering your home, and much more. There are endless amounts as to what they can do to protect you.</p>
 
<p>Lastly, their own personalities make it ten times better. Each dog is quirky in their own ways. You might have a dog that would do anything for an extra treat or hates men. I really can't say how your dog's personality will
be like but as you slowly notice these quirks, they turn into things you learn to love and laugh at.</p>
