<h2>Origin of Dogs</h2>
<p>In modern times, dogs have become a popular companion for many individuals. A quick walk in the neighborhood will prove just that. But, these cute and fluffy companions didn't always exist.
 Going back 40,000 years, researchers have come to the conclusion that dogs are descendents of wolves. It's assumed that humans formed a bond with wolves and they slowly evolved into dogs. 
 However, within the scientific community there is a lot of controversy surrounding this topic. Scientists are uncertain about how wolves became dogs. Some believe that hunter-gatherers domesticated wolves 
 while others believe that wolves domesticated by themselves. Like any other discovery, scientists are resorting to DNA to uncover the truths; it certainly provided some insight. Scientists compared mitochondiral genomes of 
 modern dogs and wolves to discovered fossils. They now believe that wolves were domesticated in either Europe of western Siberia. To be fair, the only thing scientists definitively know is that dogs came from wolves. 
 There are too many unknowns for scientists to be certain and all the wolves that gave rise to dogs are now extinct. At the end of the day, it's pretty cool to say that your dog is related to a wolf.
